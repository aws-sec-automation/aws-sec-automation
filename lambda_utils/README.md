# AWS Lambda Function & Cloudformation Utils


In this folder we want to collect lambda functions that could be useful for security purposes. Those functions could be configured with Cloudwatch to respond events or running periodically.

## Lambda & Cloudformation Repositories
* [AWS Lambda for Billing](https://github.com/asc-lab/aws-lambda-billing)
* [AWS Lambda functions for security controls](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-security-controls)
* [Collection of Serverless security resources](https://github.com/puresec/awesome-serverless-security)
* [AWS Serverless security workshop](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-serverless-security-workshop)

## Lambda Code
* [Lambda for shuting down instances with a specific tag](./ebs-backup.py)
* [Lambda for creating EC2 Volume snapshots](./stop-instances.py)
